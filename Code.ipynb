Therefore, the patch can be classified under the \"Inefficient coding for target micro-architecture\" or \"Inefficient algorithm/data-structure and their implementation\" categories. It is important to consider the specific micro-architecture and algorithmic/data-structure limitations to optimize performance.\n"
